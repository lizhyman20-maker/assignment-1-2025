			LOOK! ITS KAMILLAH HANKS!

			<h2>A controversial Democrat in the heart of Staten Island.</h2>
			<p>
				Kamillah Hanks, a true-blue democrat in the 49th District of Staten Island, is running for re-election. She's young, she's sharp, and she's anti-Trump. The only problem? Her office may not be as charming. The Office of Kamillah Hanks has been acccused by more than five former employees for religious discrimination, one individual citing blowback because he identified as a Muslim. 
			</p>

			<p> Hanks has referred to these five as "disgruntled workers", and has yet to admit any fault from her start in 2021 to now.

			<h2>She wants to increase feminist values in NYC! Hooray! </h2>
			<p>
				Although I was not able to get a quote from her people, (I called countless times and sent emails, but they couldn't seem to follow up!), I do know that Hanks is a staunch advocate for women's rights, as she has helped foster the "Women's Caucus" created in 2020. This caucus serves a diplomatic council that mitigates gender-based violence in all five boroughs.

				It didn't occur to me until just recently, but Kamillah Hanks already won her re-election just this summer! I know she was approved for this assigment, but it looks like the voters beat us to it! 			</p>
